# University_Management_System_Project
The main goal of the project is to reduce manual effort in managing university operations, improve data accuracy, and provide quick access to academic and administrative information, thereby enhancing overall efficiency.
The University Management System (UMS) is a desktop-based application designed to streamline and automate essential academic and administrative tasks within a university. The system provides a centralized platform where students, faculty, and administrators can efficiently manage information and perform necessary operations.

Key features include:

Student Management – storing, updating, and retrieving student records such as personal details, academic performance, and enrollment information.

Faculty Management – maintaining faculty profiles, managing leaves, and assigning responsibilities.

Course & Examination Handling – managing courses, uploading results, and providing examination details.

Fee Management – checking and updating student fee status with payment records.

Search & Retrieval – quick access to student and faculty details using enrollment numbers or other parameters.

Technical Overview

Frontend: Implemented using Java Swing and AWT for a user-friendly graphical interface.

Backend: Data storage and retrieval managed through relational database tables for structured organization.

Data Structures Used: Arrays and lists for managing collections, HashMaps for mapping IDs to details, and graph-based conceptualization for route or connectivity logic.
